Journalling has many benefits, but it is not always an easy process. We often come up with various excuses — I don’t have the time, I don’t have my paper journal with me, etc. Sitting down to write about and wrestle with our deepest thoughts and emotions is also difficult as it can be painful at times. Hence, LifeXP aims to provide a convenient, safe, and fun way to journal.

LifeXP combines gamification and journalling into a chatbot. It aims to provide a safe, fun and convenient way for you to pen down your thoughts and even organise them for browsing later. At the end of your journalling sessions, you are rewarded with experience points to reward you for your effort.

I also submitted this project for the MindfulHacks hackathon and achieved 3rd place ([Hackathon submission on DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/lifexp-gamified-journalling-chatbot)).
