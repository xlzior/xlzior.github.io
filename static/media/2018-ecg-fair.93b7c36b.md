In 2018, I developed the **Hwa Chong Institution: Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Fair 2018 Mobile App** as part of a 2-person team.

The ECG Fair is a yearly event mainly for JC1 students to find out more about their university options. Representatives from the various universities and faculties are invited to the school to set up booths during the session and interact with students to answer any questions they have.

In the hopes of making the session more fruitful for JC1 students, the ECG unit collaborated with the Hwa Chong Infocomm and Robotics Society (HCIRS) to create a companion mobile app for the event.
