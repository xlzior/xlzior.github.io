In 2019, as part of Hwa Chong Institution's 100th anniversary celebrations, I created a mobile app to document the diverse range of flora and fauna that can be found on the school's campus. This included trail markers overlaid on a life map of the campus, photos of the sites and detailed writeups of each species found on campus.

This was a team effort involving many photographers, flora and fauna experts and developers.
