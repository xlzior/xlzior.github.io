In 2018, I led a team and developed a cross-platform mobile app for students to navigate and take notes at schoolâ€™s university and career fair, with more than 300 downloads.

Over the course of this project, I communicated professionally with career guidance counsellor to determine project requirements and manage project deadlines.
